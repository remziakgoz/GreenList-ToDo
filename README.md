- **Testing:** Both **UI** and **ViewModel** tests are written to ensure the correctness of the app.

## Technologies

- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose**
- **MVVM Architecture**
- **Room (Database)**
- **Koin** (Dependency Injection)
- **Mockito** (For testing)
- **JUnit**
- **Coroutines** (For asynchronous operations)
